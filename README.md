# CChat
A Chat Server writen in C for C programmers only.

## Description

The application aim is to provide a chat room between more users (as clients) and a server. Along with C language, we used TCP and BSD Sockets for our implementation.

The server will accept more conections from the application's users.

The acces of the application will be granted through user autenthification that must respect the following: a unique e-mail (or username) and a password.

After the authentification, the clients will be able to use an interface through which sending of messages between the users in the same chat room will be possible.
The next step will be that all the other users to be notified when a message appears in the chat. The messages will be seen in the chat also by the sender.
